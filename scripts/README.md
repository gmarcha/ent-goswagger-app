# Installation and initialisation scripts

These scripts facilitate the setup of a project using entgo and goswagger stack.\
They only perform installation and basic configurations.\
Do not use them to perform code generation on a project that has already been setup.\
Use Makefile rules instead (`make gen.<rule>`).
