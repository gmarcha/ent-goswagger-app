# Installation scripts

These scripts facilitate the setup of a project using entgo or goswagger.\
They only perform installation and basic initialisation.\
Please read instructions in script code and comment/uncomment functionnalities.\

Do not use them to perform code generation on a project that has already been setup.\
Use Makefile rules instead (`make gen.<rule>`).
